# strava-backup Demo

This is a live demo of the [strava-backup](https://github.com/yarikoptic/strava-backup)
web frontend using synthetic data.

**[View Demo](https://yarikoptic.github.io/strava-backup/)**

## About

This demo showcases the lightweight web frontend that provides:
- Interactive map with activity markers
- Sessions list with filtering and search
- Session detail view with GPS track
- Statistics dashboard with charts

## Note

This demo uses synthetic data generated for illustration purposes.
The data structure follows the strava-backup format but does not contain
real Strava activities.

While this branch is managed as a DataLad dataset for reproducibility,
you do **not** need DataLad or git-annex to clone or view this demo.
A simple `git clone` works fine.
