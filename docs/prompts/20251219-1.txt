immediate feedback from immediate changes:

very good, besides that you ran it for december of the last year! I now did manual run for this december and it worked nicely!

- Add to templated README.md recommendation to install visidata with
  pyarrow to view those parquet and other structured records files.

- Spurious logs: even running strava-backup sync --help produces log file!
  that's undesired -- see so that running --help or --version does not
  produce logs!

- log filenames and --after/--before options: use the same datetime formatting
   and use format like 20251202T222856 not 20251202-222856 as you do in
  the logs now so no spaces/dashes (keep allowing for dates or date times).

- "kudos" entries in info.json seems to lack athlete_id -- set to null,
  investigate and fix.

- sub=yhalchenko/sessions.tsv issues:

  - has columns "type" and "sport" with root= prefix and then in quotes
    -- is that necessary?  I think we could just store value, e.g. just
    `Workout` instead of `root='Workout'`.  Add to spec needing QA unittests to
    ensure that values in such files stored correctly and then add such a test

  - instead of "has_photos" column, add column "photos_path" which would be the
    path to the photos folder if thereare photos, and empty if not, e.g.
    ses=20241224T121430/photos/

    then I could use visidata to open that folder

- Also then adjust spec, refactor code and testing to move
  .strava-backup.toml under .strava-backup/config.toml (do not forget to adjust
  git-annex settings etc) and also split away the changing part of
  authentication (access_token, refresh_token, token_expires_at) to reside in
  some .strava-backup/oauth-tokens.toml which would be gitignore'd in that
  folder -- there is no point to commit/track those at all in annex or not

FYI I have tagged current state of that existing backup repo
/home/yoh/proj/strava-backup-mine as _revert-20251219-1 and then git reset hard
to that prior state where we had no succesfull run so we coul retry on this
month (not 2024).  Use `datalad run` when you do execution as you provisioned
in Makefile as well.
